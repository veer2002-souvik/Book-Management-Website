## 🛠️ Key Backend Optimizations

- **Enabled GZIP Compression** using `compression` middleware for smaller payloads.
- **Added Indexes** on `title` and `status` fields for faster queries.
- **Implemented Pagination** and field projections in `/books` endpoint to reduce data transfer and query load.
- **Optimized API Response** to only send required fields.

---

## ⚛️ Key Frontend Optimizations

- **Debounced Search Input** with `lodash.debounce` to reduce unnecessary renders and API calls.
- **Pagination Controls** for efficient data navigation and reduced payload per request.
- **Virtualized Book List** using `react-window` for efficient rendering of large lists.
- **Memoized Components** (`React.memo`, `useMemo`) to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Requested Only Needed Fields** from the backend to minimize payload size.

## 📝 Closing Summary

Performance optimization led to:
- **Reduced frontend render times** (BookCard: ~0.18–0.27ms, previously ~0.75–0.85ms)
- **Lower memory usage** (8MB, previously 9MB)
- **Smaller response payloads** (540 bytes, previously 571 bytes)
- **More scalable backend** (pagination, projections, compression, indexing)

While API response time increased slightly due to added pagination and monitoring overlays, the app is now more efficient, scalable, and ready for larger datasets and more users.
